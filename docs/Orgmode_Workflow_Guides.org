** DONE The Principles :ORGMODE:
CLOSED: [2025-09-07 Sun 02:54]
1. *Do Not Add Tasks Indiscriminately* \\
   Not every task should go into the system. Avoid filling the system with trivial =tasks= and diluting things that matter. Only add =tasks= that matters
2. *Not All Tasks have to be done* \\
   There are two reasons:
   - First, =Tasks= could be /de-prioritize/ or become unnecessary
   - Second, there are limitations and we can not do everything (/priorities/ matter)
3. *Reduce The Numbers of Open Loops* \\
   Open =loops= are =tasks= which have been started but not yet finished. They stay in our mind and occupy some of the our limited /working memory/, makes it harder to focus on other =tasks=

#+NAME:Little's Law
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[!NOTE]
/Little's Law/ [fn:1] Points out that the more open =loops=, the more it takes to finish each =loops= on average
#+END_QUOTE

4. *Reduce the Decision Making of What Next* \\
   The system should suggest the user what to do next so that the user can reserve the energy for the real tasks. Reduce skipping hard tasks for easy one subconsciously
